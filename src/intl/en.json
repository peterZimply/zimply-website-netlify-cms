    "ia_text01": "Intelligent Automation is an area within AI (Artificial Intelligence) that includes different technologies and concepts such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Chatbots, Computer Vision, NLP (Natural Language Processing) and other AI-tools. Intelligent Automation are technologies that are used to automate processes of different kinds. These technologies combined, such as RPA and Machine Learning, are the core of automation and contribute to smarter and more powerful solutions. Intelligent Automation is changing the way companies and organisations are run. Taking on from the digitalisation that has been going on for many years, Intelligent Automation is the next step on the journey.",
    "ia_text02": "The main purpose of Intelligent Automation is to improve the employee- and customer experience while increasing productivity. When companies and organisations automate repetitive, time consuming and tedious tasks, employees get time over to perform more stimulating and creative tasks such as strategic work or customer related processes.This contributes to the customer getting a faster interaction and better response from the company. In addition to achieving time and cost savings, Intelligent Automation also contributes to an improved quality, capacity and efficiency within the organisation.",
    "ia_title02": "RPA",
    "ia_text03": "RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation and is a digital workforce that is used for automating and performing standardised processes that otherwise would be carried out manually. The automations save time for employees who instead can perform more creative and stimulating tasks. RPA is also known as “Robotics”, “Robots”, “Digital Workforce” or “Digital Assistants”.",
    "ia_text04": "The Digital Assistants are controlled by a software that is developed based on a clear set of rules and instructions and can interact with most types of applications, such as Microsoft Excel, websites, e-mail, databases, ERP’s such as SAP as well as custom built systems. The integration of the systems can be done by simulating mouse clicks and keyboard typing or by using existing integrations like API’s.",
    "ia_text05": "Processes that are suited for automation with RPA are often rule based with clear decision paths while being time consuming, repetitive and tedious tasks.",
    "ia_title03": "The advantages for automating with RPA is:",
    "ia_title04": "Increased profitability and productivity",
    "ia_text06": " The productivity increases because the Digital Assistant can work 24/7 all days of the week and can easily scale up.",
    "ia_title05": "Quality Assurance: ",
    "ia_text07": "Reduces the risk of human error as the Robot always performs the process in the same way as it has been developed, this means that the alternative cost is reduced.",
    "ia_title06": "Save time:",
    "ia_text08": " Routine work tasks are done automatically which creates space for more value creating and creative work as well as happier employees.",
    "ia_title07": "Customer Satisfaction:",
    "ia_text09": " Automation of processes with RPA ensures faster interaction with customers while also freeing up time for employees to focus on your clients.",
    "ia_text10": "RPA can be combined with other technologies or be used as a tool in parts of a process flow.",
    "ia_text11": "The leading RPA tools as of 2021 are UiPath, Microsoft Power Automate, Blue Prism, Automation Anywhere, NICE och Kofax. ",
    "ia_title08": "Chatbot",
    "ia_text12": "Chatbots are primarily used for automating customer dialogues by letting a robot answer the simple and frequent questions that are asked. The most simple chatbots are command based dialogue robots, these receive a command and execute a rule based interpretation while later answering the client or performing a task. More advanced chatbots are based on and use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, they are therefore self-learning and can interpret questions better and give precise answers. Chatbots can handle questions both in text and be voice conversations.",
    "ia_text13": "A chatbot is used to satisfy both the customer service employees that answer the frequently asked questions and the customers who expect a prompt and correct response. Chatbots can reply to questions 24/7, all days of the week. Questions are replied without waiting times or queues. The tasks that a chatbots can perform should be standardised and easy to understand in order to reduce the interpretation that the bot has to do and to ensure that the replies are correct.",
    "ia_text14": "Primarily a chatbot should answer “How to” questions where the user gets a reply that includes information or guidance. A good example of this is an FAQ, service desk or acting an intranet. A chatbot can reply to “Do” questions, but then the bot needs support by a secondary automationtool that can execute on demand and perform the request that the user has made. This is done by integrating directly with existing systems such as an ERP or CRM system or by a RPA robot that is triggered and executes the activity in a system.",
    "ia_text15": "Some of the most common tools for chatbots are IPsoft Amelia, Boost.AI, SAP Conversational AI, Amazon Lex and Humany.",
    "ia_title09": "Machine Learning",
    "ia_text16": "Machine Learning is a term for a technology that consists of computer algorithms that improves automatically over time through inputs of large amounts of data and experience. The basis for Machine Learning are advanced algorithms that help the machine to learn to find and handle patterns that can be complex for a human to interpret. In Machine Learning you usually tell the computer the goal that needs to be achieved, but without telling the computer how to reach the goal. Hence, the computer only gets an input based on data and an expected output. Based on this the computer uses Machine Learning to reach the goal and by training itself on the data and expected outcome. When the training is done the computer will have a Machine Learning model and algorithm that is used to reach the outcome given a certain input. This is in contrast to traditional programming where you usually tell the computer what it should do in given situations, hence giving the computer an input and the rules to succeed but not the outcome.",
    "ia_title10": "Machine Learning consists of three parts:",
    "ia_text17": "1. Learning: ",
    "ia_text18": "The first step is to learn the computer to execute a specific task through supervised learning or unsupervised learning. In supervised learning you provide the algorithm with both input and expected output; labeled data that is used as training data. In unsupervised learning you only provide the algorithm with an input where the purpose is to identify the relationship and group them.",
    "ia_title11": "2. Training: ",
    "ia_text19": "The second stage is to train the computer to reach an output as accurate as possible by providing training data.",
    "ia_title12": "3. Evaluation: ",
    "ia_text20": "Lastly the output needs to be evaluated with existing data in order to ensure that the result is correct and accurate.",
    "ia_text21": "Machine Learning is a continuous process that makes the algorithm and model smarter and better the more data that it is exposed to. It is particularly useful in cases when making unstructured data such as images, e-mails, audio, video and chats to structured data that is readable and useful. Machine Learning is very powerful in combination with other technologies like RPA and chatbots where the Digital Assistant can use more tools and can read unstructured data that has been converted into structured data.",
    "ia_title13": "Conversational Intelligence",
    "ia_text22": "Conversational Intelligence is a method that uses combined AI technologies to analyse the information in a voice conversation. This is done by extracting, identifying and categorising the content in a conversation. Conversational Intelligence can be used to identify patterns in the interaction in a Customer Service Center in order to understand what questions or complaints are being communicated in real time for the company. Conversational AI can be used to summarize individual conversations. The details from many conversations can be used to find patterns and keywords that can be visualized as current trends. For example a Customer Service Center can get real time information of the current sentiment that customers are expressing in phone calls.",
    "ia_title14": "NLP",
    "ia_text23": "Natural Language Processing is a branch of Artificial Intelligence in which a computer / machine is programmed to understand, process and generate human language, both in spoken and written form. This process plays an important role in human-machine interaction.",
    "ia_text24": "Statistical NLP means that the computer is provided with algorithms, by means of which the computer trains itself through Machine Learning. This is now the most common way to build NLP as the computer learns as it is exposed to data and therefore expands its understanding and ability to provide accurate output. NLP can also be programmed based on handwritten rules instead of these algorithms, this is called Rule-based NLP. In order for a computer programmed with rules to be able to provide more accurate output, the rules must become more and more complex.",
    "ia_text25": "Examples of what NLP can be used for are voice control of mobile phones (eg Siri or Google Assistant), voice-controlled translation apps and spelling functions in word processing programs. The most common use case is chatbots.",
    "ia_title15": "OCR",
    "ia_text26": "Optical Character Recognition (sometimes also called text recognition) is a technology that converts an image into digital, readable and editable text for a machine and computer. An image could be, for example, a PDF file, a photographed text or a scanned document. OCR works with both typed and handwritten text (HWR). Advanced OCR can also extract text formatting.",
    "ia_text27": "The software converts the image of text to a black and white version and based on that the program can read characters from the dark areas on the light background. Once a character is identified, it translates to ASCII code for the computer to handle.",
    "ia_text28": "One way to teach the machine to interpret and recognize characters is exposing it to texts in different fonts and formats. There are also algorithms that detect, for example, the number of angles and curves in a character to characterize it.",
    "ia_title16": "Computer Vision",
    "ia_text29": "Vision means that the computer, with the help of Machine Learning, learns to see, in other words to recognize and interpret images or video sequences. Computer Vision is a technology that is delivered by several players in the market. For example, Google has a variant called Google Cloud Vision. Amazon Web Services has Amazon Recognition. The service is also available from Microsoft as part of Microsoft Cognitive Services, called Microsoft Vision.",
    "ia_text30": "There are many uses in several industries for this technology. Violence, harmful behavior and other inappropriate content can be detected in images and videos. Above all, Computer Vision can be used to read and extract information from photos of invoices or receipts that would normally be impossible for a computer to read. The ability to recognize, categorize and compare things in an image can be practical from a security perspective when you can, for example, distinguish weapons or other illegal items. Identifying which dog breed is visible in an image, distinguishing well-known brand logos and tagging images with labels for categorization are other functions within Computer Vision.",
    "ia_text31": "Being able to identify and compare faces provides the opportunity to assess the number of people in a place, also called face recognition. This technique can also determine facial expressions and thus interpret a person’s emotions, such as whether the person looks happy or scared. The technology can also locate position on eyes, nose, mouth - and with this, effects, decorations and filters can be applied to images and videos. Furthermore, Computer Vision can be used to develop game controls that can be used without hands, controlled by, for example, blinking your eyes or head movements.",
